# Web Scraping and Text Preprocessing Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a website and preprocess the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
Specifically, we fetch the HTML content from a given URL, extract the text, and apply various preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal to clean the text data.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
 HTML content is fetched from a specified URL, and the raw text is extracted using BeautifulSoup.

 ### Text Preprocessing
The text is converted to lowercase, punctuation is removed, and tokenization is applied to split the text into individual words. Common stopwords are filtered out, and stemming is used to reduce words to their root form. Finally, a set of unique words is extracted for a concise representation of the processed text.

## Results
The project successfully scrapes the HTML content from a specified URL and preprocesses the text to extract a set of unique, cleaned words. This is useful for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or feature extraction for machine learning models.

## Conclusion
This project provides a solid foundation for web scraping and text preprocessing using Python. The extracted and cleaned text can be used for further analysis or as input to machine learning algorithms for NLP tasks.
